## Vision:
We aim to create a travel-assitant application that can be used on multiple platforms (Desktop, Phones, etc. ) 
This assistant provides you with Vietnam's map and information of many specific locations including restaurants,
places of interest, hotels, resorts, etc. Furthermore, it aids you in the complex plan-making job. You can choose from our
template database or start from scratch if you're an experienced traveler.
